![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work%20in%20Progress-yellow)

D-Upload is a **cloud file storage application** built with **Node.js & React**, utilizing **Discord as storage**. This project allows users to upload, share, and download files securely while leveraging Discord for storage.

## Features

‚úÖ **File Sharing** - Share files with others using unique links.  
‚úÖ **Download Files** - Retrieve and reconstruct files from Discord storage.  
‚úÖ **Folder Management** - Organize files into folders for easy access.  
‚úÖ **User Accounts** - Sign up, log in, and manage stored files securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Storage:** Discord API (using bots)

## How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User uploads a file** from the frontend.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Server processes the file** by splitting it into chunks.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chunks are sent to Discord** and stored as messages.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Metadata is saved** in the database for tracking.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **File can be shared** via a unique link.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **On download,** the server retrieves chunks, reconstructs the file, and provides it to the user.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Original file is deleted** from the server after processing.
